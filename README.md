Codux empowers users to create [custom templates](https://help.codux.com/kb/en/article/kb26227) for their projects, which serve as a foundation for new boards. These board templates are designed to include all the essential elements a user might need, ensuring consistency and adherence to design intentions.

The project comes with board templates that include connections to test data or real data, and components or pages.
